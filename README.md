# Healthcare-Readmission-Insights-Dashboard
Project Overview
This project analyzes 100k+ patient records across 130 U.S. hospitals to uncover insights into demographics, hospital stays, and readmission risks.  
The goal is to identify trends that can help healthcare providers improve patient care and reduce costly readmissions.

# Dataset
Source:Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset (Kaggle)  
Records:100,000+  
Key Columns:Race, Gender, Age, Time in Hospital, Admission Type, Discharge Disposition, Readmitted  

# Dashboard Highlights
The Tableau dashboard provides insights into:
- Patients by Race – majority are Caucasian, followed by AfricanAmerican.  
- Patients by Gender – slightly higher proportion of female patients.  
- Readmissions Count – ~9k patients were readmitted within 30 days, ~24k after 30 days.  
- Readmission by Age Group – peak risk observed in ages 60–80.  
- Avg. Hospital Stay by Admission Type – stays range 3–5 days depending on admission type.

# Key Takeaways
- Early readmissions (<30 days) remain a significant challenge, especially in older age groups.  
- Insights can guide targeted interventions to improve hospital efficiency and patient outcomes.
